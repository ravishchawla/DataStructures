DataStructures
==============

Project Objectives

 - To understand how different algorithms and Data Structures are implemented.
 - to learn by implementation the computational complexity of differnet algorithms, and the usefulness of specific data structures as compared to others.
 - To practice programming in the languages Java and C.
 
 
 This Repository contains the implementations of differnet Algorithms and Data Structures, written as part of the course Data Structures and Algorithms (CS 1332).
